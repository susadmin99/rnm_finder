Rick and Morty character finder.

API I used in the project: https://rickandmortyapi.com/

The projects main goal is to showcase all of the characters of the popular cartoon series "Rick and Morty".
It includes features such as searching for a specific character, paginated table (20 characters per page), a seperate "Profile" page which collects all the important data for the selected character.

Project uses Python with Flask for the backend part and html, css, javascript and Tailwind CSS.
I chose python and flask because for a long time I wanted to try the python backed webapp.

Currently I know about one feature which is not added yet to the project and that it's can't do character search on the whole API but it can only search from characters listed in the table's current page.
